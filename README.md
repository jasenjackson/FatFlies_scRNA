### Single cell RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline

Single cell RNA-seq analysis is a novel method in next generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics, and computational biology. The difference between bulk RNA-seq (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is that a transcriptomic library is built and barcoded from one cell compared to lysing a bunch of different cells and mixing their transcripts. While RNA-Seq is incredibly useful for analysing the transcriptome, it only provides an average snapshot of gene expression across a variety of cells. This can make interpretation and extrapolation more difficult and biased when forming conclusions from the data. The benefit of doing scRNA-seq is that you can get a snapshot of a single cell's transcriptome which can allow for more meaningful comparisons across conditions when analysing expression data. Due to this novelty, a gold standard for analysing this data has not emerged. Single cell analysis pipelines will vary depending on the wet-lab protocol; each protocol has it's pros and cons depending on the biological question.

Non-software requirements to use this wrapper pipeline:
* CEL-Seq2 Libraries
* Illumina Sequencing

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
